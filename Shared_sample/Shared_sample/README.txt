Since the dataset size is too large to be attached as a supplementary file (Size limit 100Mb). We providecode for a sample log that should work in the same manner as the entire dataset would. 
For quick and easy use, implementation is done in  Jupter notebooks. We will share the entire data with all corrosponding codes and utils (Processing .py files, gradcam code, etc) via a github link after the blind review process is over.

This attached code is tested on TF1.12 and implemented in a UNINX enviroment -- if running on windows make sure to add proper paths
Also, make sure to include/install all TF dependencies as per used in the code.
Best,
