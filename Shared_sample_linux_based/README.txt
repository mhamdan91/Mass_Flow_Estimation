Since the dataset size is too large to be attached as a supplimentary file (Size limit 100Mb). We provide code for a sample log that should work in the same manner as the entire dataset would. 
For convenience, implementation is done in Jupter notebook. We will share the complete version with corrosponding codes and utils (Processing .py files, gradcam code, etc) via a github link after the blind review process is over.

This attached code is tested on TF1.12 and compabatible with linux and windows machines. Also, make sure to include/install all TF dependencies as per used in the code.
Best,
